				This is a famous model hack by StupidMarioBros1Fan. He made it, so credit to him.<br />

Not only does this mod replace Mario with Bowser, but it also replaces<br />
all of the icons of Mario. Even the opening cutscene!<br />
<br />
<strong><em>This doesn't work in NewerSMBW.</em></strong><br />
<br />
Here's his video showing it off.<br />

				This is a mod created by StupidMarioBros1Fan. So credit to him.<br />
<br />
This is a texture and model hack that recolors Bowser to look like Dark Bowser from <em>Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</em>.<br />
It also slightly remodels Bowser's hair to resemble Dark Bowser's. StupidMarioBros1Fan also made Bowser's voice deeper.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>This is untested in NewerSMBW, but it probably won't work.</em></strong><br />
My theory is that the Newer Team may have modified Bowser's original arc file to allow certain things in their boss fights.<br />
<br />
Here's StupidMarioBros1Fan video on this.<br />

				You know how in NewerSMBW Worlds after 9 are then the alphabet? (World A, World B, World C, etc)<br />
<br />
I think you can actually remove that function, or change what World starts counting like that.<br />
In the "newer.cpp" file, there is a line like so:<br />
<div class="codeblock">	dest[0] = (world &gt;= 10) ? (world-10+'A') : (world+'0');</div>First of all, 'dest[0]' is the World number, 'dest[1]' is the dash, 'dest[2]' is the first letter of the course ID, and 'dest[3]' is the second. I believe 'dest[4]' is an unused value, since it's set to equal 0 which is basically nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm no expert, but I think if you replace both of the '10s' in <code>(world >= 10) ? (world-10+'A')</code> with a different number, like 18, then the letters will only show when the World # from <code>Levelinfo.bin</code> is 18 or higher. I'm planning on testing this out in the future.<br />
<br />
That edited line would look like this:<br />
<div class="codeblock">	dest[0] = (world &gt;= 18) ? (world-18+'A') : (world+'0');</div>If you wanted to remove the letters from the World ID, you would just need to replace that line with this:<br />
<div class="codeblock">	dest[0] = (world+'0');</div><br />
This is all theory, and isn't tested yet.<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />
