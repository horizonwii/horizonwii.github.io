NewSMBW's 08-06 also doesn't have warping across edges. I checked. It does have rising lava, though.<br />

				Hi! In NSMBW, some course slots have hardcoded functions. I was hoping we could all cooperate and make a list of all <br />
hardcoded features in each course slot! This includes sprites that are required to let a course work.<br />
I'll place what I know, and then add whatever you guys know! <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br />
<br />
Also, if you're a moderator, feel free to add/edit anything you know, when you want to. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/wink.png" /><br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">01-01</button><div class="spoiled hidden">Area 1 Zone 1 has an hardcoded Peach Castle BG at the start of the zone.</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">01-40 (Title Screen)</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It requires the entrance to be moved a few blocks to the right when modifying this level or the game may crash.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: If you were to use the Special Exit Controller (Sprite 179) and check-mark "Exit Stage (Walking Left)", <br />
when Mario and Co touch the Exit Controller, the screen will go black for about 3 seconds, and reload the title screen!</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">01-41 (And all Toad Houses)</button><div class="spoiled hidden">No life counter, no coin and point counter, no star coins and no time limit. Placing a Toad shows the related message.</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">02-24</button><div class="spoiled hidden">This course uses the autoscroll sprite and loops around the course. You need to choose the right path<br />
to continue through the course. Here's some gameplay of it.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Nzjpi7_wI0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
Attempting to modify the stage can result in:<br />
-Collisions not matching tiles<br />
-Random character warping<br />
-Continuous "wrong way" noise<br />
-Awkward screen scrolling that make the stage unplayable.</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">08-03</button><div class="spoiled hidden">Any sprite using the Water's Graphic coding (Water, Lava, Sand, Poison Water, Raft/Rising and Falling Water), whether in or not in a location, is affected by a code that makes them use a wave effect. The waves are seemingly 4-5 blocks.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hrgjagI-Ffk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
They all gain the Lava's collision, so interaction with it on this course slot results in death.<br />
</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">08-24</button><div class="spoiled hidden">Beating this course takes you to the credits. Also, the textures of the Bowser boss fight are a little<br />
weird if it was played on a course other than 08-24. It seems to have some textures that are only loaded on stage slot<br />
08-24</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">09-05 / 09-06 / 09-07</button><div class="spoiled hidden">Some levels just don't want to work on these slots. Cause unknown.</div></div><br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link.

2-3 years ago, MrBean35000vr and Chadderz started a project of online multiplayer for basically any local multiplayer game<br />
on the Wii. Coincidentally, they started this project with New Super Mario Bros Wii! They made two videos on this. One as<br />
an announcement, and another as a proper Proof of Concept.<br />

There hasn't been much mention of this, until about a year ago. They said they'd continue this later.<br />
<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'>Posted by MrBean35000vr</div><div class='quotecontent'>We haven't done this for a while, but we will be working on it again at some point, since this project is too good to let die. Eventually It might become generic enough that it could support anything with local multiplayer, we will see!﻿</div></div><br />
There is its early source available <a href="https://github.com/MrBean35000vr/netslug-wii">here</a>.<br />
<br />
And thanks to 9211tr for finding this, we have a compiled version! The version you can download and use!<br />
 <div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'>Posted by 9211tr</div><div class='quotecontent'>BTW, a compiled/binary download is here, thanks to louisboss99 on GBATemp (I didn't compile it or upload it): <a href="https://mega.nz/#!i9gUAZLa!5xnoZ7uZx05hVbgqFYmce4J2Y_n8naPfjAZM7qvrbT4">https://mega.nz/#!i9gUAZLa!5xnoZ7uZx05hVbgqFYmce4J2Y_n8naPfjAZM7qvrbT4</a><br />
<br />
I found the link for the compiled/binary download on <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/compiling-netslug.435807/">this thread on GBATemp,</a> when doing a Google search for a compiled/binary download of the project.<br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />
