				Welcome to the Sprite Usage Tutorial ! In this post i listed every sprite and how to use it correctly in your levels. Search the sprites you want, open the spoilers and have a good read ! (This is not done yet, and will take a lot of time to complete, if ever)<br />
<br />
Sprites and/or settings marked with an asterisk are only available in NewerSMBW.<br />
<br />
Remember, this is not meant to be strictly followed, it just provides guidelines to use them in levels correctly.<br />
<br />
<strong>NO ASSIGNED FUNCTION</strong> (Sprite 10-19, 22,...)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">These sprites do nothing, they are completely useless. There's no need to place them in your level.</div></div><br />
<strong>Character</strong> (Sprite 0-9)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Reggie Next only<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Unknown<br />
Notes : Sprite 9 is the most stable one</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
This sprite creates a stationary clone that (in normal Reggie) will be shown one tile above the sprite's placement. The clone will not move; nonetheless, the 'twinkle' animation works. Also, this clone can shoot fireballs if the player has a Fire Flower. It seems the initial purpose of this sprite was to function as an entrance. Additionally, depending on the position of this sprite relative to an entrance, this clone can sometimes be controlled instead of the one created by the entrance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
None. This sprite is really buggy, and is pretty much useless for everything, because it does not move.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Looks Left : No need to explain<br />
- Entrance Type : Same list as the normal entrances<br />
- Character : You can choose one of the four playable characters. Please note that this requires the actual player to work, or the game will freeze (e.g spawning Blue Toad in Single-Player)</div></div><br />
*<strong>Koopa Throw</strong> (Sprite 10)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : No</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
This is used in the final Bowser fight. It causes Bowser to throw objects at Mario, if he reaches a predefined position.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
While the functions of this sprite are included in Sprite 213 (Captain Bowser), this allows more customization (Z-Order, thrown object, throw direction...)<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Is In Front : With this enabled, thrown objects will pass over other on-screen elements and not behind them<br />
- Type : You can change the thrown object to any of these<br />
- Throws Right : Explains itself.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Roll Your Own Model Sprite</strong> (Sprite 11)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
This sprite can load custom models from the SD Card, which you can inject yourself, or just use the available ones. The 3D Models can be easily swapped, but have to reside in the same file, otherwise the game will crash. Just don't swap 3D Models or Animations between different files.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- Most models are used in cutscenes or title screens, but can be used to make some great scenery.<br />
- The sprite containing the model needs to be placed in the level as well, or the game will crash. In the spoiler below is a list of models conveniently divided in categories, with description and the required sprites.<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>These 3 models are used in different places and have different requirements (underlined)</em><br />
<br />
- Cloud : A cloud, used in World C-2, <u>needs Loose Arrow</u><br />
- Tree Canopy A/B/C : Autumn tree foliage of different colors, <u>they need Chestnut Goomba</u><br />
- Tree Canopy D : Green tree foliage, used in 1-Tower, <u>needs Chestnut Goomba</u><br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 6 models are used in the opening and require OpeningScene.arc to work (therefore they can't be used outside it)</em><br />

- Opening Balloon Green : Green Balloon<br />
- Opening Mario : Mario<br />
- Opening Luigi : Luigi<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 4 models are present in the cutscene after the final battle, and require either Kamek or Peach in the cage.</em><br />
<br />
- Bowser : Bowser after falling from his ship<br />
- Broken Ship : Bowser's broken airship (supports animation, which moves the broken blades)<br />
- Player Clown Car : The clown cars without an owner that the players leave behind (supports animation, which tilts the car)<br />
- Violet Tree : The tree Peach's cage is hanging from<br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 10 models are used in the title screen after the credits, and require the Beta Arrow Block to work. 5 are the Characters, while the other 5 are the Clown Cars.</em><br />
<br />
- Demo Mario End : Mario<br />
- Demo Luigi End : Luigi<br />
- Demo Toad A End : Yellow Toad<br />
- Demo Toad B End : Blue Toad<br />
- Demo Peach End : Peach (UNUSED)<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 6 models are used in the "100% Complete" titlescreen, and require the Loose Arrow to work correctly.</em><br />
<br />
- Mario Perfect : Mario<br />
- Luigi Perfect : Luigi<br />
- Toad A Perfect : Yellow Toad<br />
- Toad B Perfect : Blue Toad<br />
- Peach Perfect : Peach (UNUSED)<br />
- Ground Perfect : Not sure what this is, but it could be the ground the characters are standing on. <u>Even then, it's not recommended for use in levels.</u><br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 10 models are unused. Theoretically, they could have been used in a past version of the "Bowser Beaten" titlescreen, but no one has tested them yet. As in the other version, 5 models are the Characters and 5 are the Clown Cars. The "Kamek in Cage" sprite is required for these to work.</em><br />
<br />
- Mario in a Clown Car : Mario<br />
- Luigi in a Clown Car : Luigi<br />
- Y.Toad in a Clown Car : Yellow Toad<br />
- B.Toad in a Clown Car : Blue Toad<br />
- Peach in a Clown Car : Peach<br />
- Mario Clown Car : Mario's Clown Car<br />
- Luigi Clown Car : Luigi's Clown Car<br />
- Yellow Toad Clown Car : Yellow Toad's Clown Car<br />
- Blue Toad Clown Car : Blue Toad's Clown Car<br />
- Peach Clown Car : Peach's Clown Car<br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
<em>These 2 models are unused, but i don't know how they look and what their requirements are.</em><br />
<br />
- Peach Castle Backdrop : Possibly a Peach Castle you can put in your background in any level ? This is just speculation.<br />
- Backdrop : I can't even speculate for this one. The only thing i know is that <u>this shouldn't be used in levels, because it may cause crashes.</u></div></div><br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Scale : Changes the Scale of the 3D Model. Value 0 is 100%, while other ones progress by 40 (1 is 40%, 2 is 80% and so on...)<br />
- Is Animating : Some models have animations available for them, which changes both their look and their behaviour. Enabling animations for models that do not support them or don't have them will crash the game. Some models have been confirmed to work, but documentation for this is near to none.<br />
- Z-Order : Changes the distance of the model from the player. Negative values are behind Layer 1, and positive ones are above it. Some in-game values :<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">- Background: -5500<br />
- Layer 2: -3300<br />
- Layer 1: 0<br />
- Player: 300<br />
- Foreground: 1200<br />
- Layer 0: 3300<br />
- Above Layer 0: 5500.0</div></div></div></div><br />
*<strong>Star Collectable</strong> (Sprite 12)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Reggie Next only<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Unknown</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
The mini stars used in the Challenge Houses in Newer. When all the stars are collected, an event is triggered.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- In an entire hack, unless you are planning to not use Challenge Houses in it, keep this element for those houses only.<br />
- If you are making a single level though, they would be a pretty good puzzle element for your stage, requiring the player to get all the stars before being able to progress/unlock things in the level. Obviously don't go crazy with these, or the game will lag.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Triggering Event ID : When all the stars in the zone with this setting on the same value are collected, this Event ID is triggered. The triggered element can be anything : Chainers, Actor Spawner, Red Coins...<br />
- Spawn if Player X Exists : This setting is extremely useful to tune the difficulty based on the number of players. Please note that the first value is 0 (always shown), and not 1 (only if 2nd player is playing) !</div></div><br />
*<strong>Rideable Clown Car with Cannon</strong> (Sprite 13)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Reggie Next only<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : No</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
The Clown Car used in the Newer Boss fight. The player can fly around freely and shoot Cannons.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- This sprite has very few interactions with other elements, so it should be used only in special occasions (such as a boss fight). Inside the spoiler is a few examples of interactions and bugs caused by them.<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">- Captain Bowser : Can be shot at<br />
- Asteroid : Can be shot and destroyed<br />
- Blocks that can be destroyed by Bob-Ombs : Can be shot and destroyed (this may not end well if it happens in a normal level)<br />
- Most enemies : Can't be shot at, but the player can still stomp them. This will cause a bug : the car will leave the player, but he can still control it from far away. He can re-enter it by ground pound, but this bug is pretty bad.<br />
</div></div><br />
- Due to the above, use this sprite in zones with enemies that Mario can't kill by stomping.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
None.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Koopa Flame</strong> (Sprite 14)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : No<br />
Note : Requires Captain Bowser (Sprite 213)</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
Causes Bowser to shoot flames when Mario approaches the sprite.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
Since it requires Captain Bowser, this can only be used during the boss fight.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Settings :</strong><br />
None.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Sing Along</strong> (Sprite 15)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Unknown</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
This sprite controls the Music House minigame, to choose prizes and the song.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- This sprite manages a minigame, so it shouldn't be used in normal levels.<br />
- You technically can do that, but after playing the minigame the level ends, so you can put this as a hidden secret or alternative level end.<br />
- If you are making a Music House, putting this is NOT enough, as the Song Blocks are a different sprite which needs to be put in manually.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- 1st/2nd/3rd/4th Prize : They explain themselves.<br />
- ??? : Used in Newer, but doesn't do anything. You can safely ignore it.<br />
- Song : Determines the song that will be played in the minigame.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Bowser Bomb Dropper</strong> (Sprite 16)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Unknown</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
When the specified event is triggered, a bomb falls on the specified target.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- This can fit greatly in dark themes (underground, lava, other Bowser-related themes...), due to it being a spiked bomb (bombs in grassland is a no-no)<br />
- Since the bomb falls from the top of the screen, make sure that place is empty, or the bomb will go through the wall and that won't look good.<br />
- Triggers can be anything, so use this to your advantage and surprise the player with bombs.<br />
- If the specified target doesn't exist, the game crashes, so beware.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Trigger Event One/Two : Both do the same thing, there's no difference between them. When this event is triggered the bomb falls, that's it.<br />
- Target : Can be both Bowser or a player. Make sure (as i already stated) that the target exists or the game will crash.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Song Block</strong> (Sprite 17)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
These are the actual music blocks used in Newer's Music House. They can both give out a sound or an item.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- To make a Music House, both this and Sprite 15 are required.<br />
- This sprite is used as a minigame prop, but it can work alone. You can use it as a music maker in a bonus area, since it only produces sound.<br />
- This block can replace ? Blocks, since it gives items out if correctly set.<br />
- It can also produce both sounds and items, so it's pretty flexible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Item Only : Disables sound-making for the block and only gives an item<br />
- Item : Can make this block hand an item to the player/s. Setting it to "None" disables this functionality.<br />
- Colour/Note : To every colour corresponds a note. If you're a mean person, you can mix them up to confuse the player in the minigame.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Bone Platform</strong> (Sprite 18)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
It's an immovable, solid-on-top Dragon Coaster piece.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- The sprite's placement represents the right side of the platform, so make sure you position it right<br />
- Since it's made of bones, put this sprite in dark and hot places (such as desert, lava...)<br />
- Making a platform such as this float in mid-air looks a bit bad, so try to attach it to something (end of a rail, bridge pieces...)<br />
- Do not set the angle to a too high value, or the character will be forced to slide off of it (as a reference, Newer does not use angles higher than 38.58°)<br />
- Don't also set it to a vertical value, or the "wall" it creates will be solid only on one side. Just don't use this sprite as a wall, please.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Rotated : If not enabled, it will always be flat<br />
- Angle : Explains itself<br />
- Faces Right : Enable this to flip the sprite horizontally<br />
- Model : Lets you choose what part of the Dragon Coaster to use</div></div><br />
*<strong>SamurShai</strong> (Sprite 19)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Probably Not</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
It's the boss of W4 (Sakura Village), a Shy Guy as Samurai.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- Since this is a boss, it only makes sense to put it in a boss room.<br />
- This boss doesn't really fit anywhere besides a Japan-themed world<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Big Boss : Makes the sprite bigger for the second fight.</div></div><br />
<strong>Goomba</strong> (Sprite 20)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
The rotten mushroom we all love to step on.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- It can be used in almost every overworld theme, from grassland to underground, jungle, beach and even sky. In Newer, the sprite retextures allow them to fit in even more themes.<br />
- One place where you should avoid using this enemy is where it would get in contact with water. It wouldn't make sense seeing a Goomba walking on the seabed, would it ?<br />
- You should also avoid placing them in levels with Bowser-related themes (Tower, Castle, Airship and Lava). Why ? Because there are much better alternatives that fit in them.<br />
- It's also recommended to not place Goombas on platforms, because they might fall before the player even reaches them. It would take out the challenge.<br />
- If you are using a size hack, be aware that the sprite won't resize if it's in the same screen as an entrance to a zone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Place Behind Other Sprites : This allows other sprites to appear in front of the Goomba. It can be useful to hide them behind other things and surprise the player. It shouldn't be misused, though.<br />
- Load-In Animation : This affects how the Goomba reacts when it shows up (the option "Tumble" should NEVER be used. It makes the Goomba look like he's walking on the background, and at the same time it will keep rolling).<br />
- *Scale/Size (Nyb5/7) : Allows setting a custom size for this sprite. It requires Sprite 246 (Special Event) and that sprite's function set to "Selective Sprite Hack" and to "Nybble 5/7".<br />
- *Colour : Allows using a custom retexture. Most of the options have straightforward names, but some don't. Gloomba is dark grey, Hyper is dark blue and Bella is light pink. Santa Goombas have a santa hat on their heads. The latest versions of Reggie should have sprite images for these.</div></div><br />
<strong>Paragoomba</strong> (Sprite 21)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
A winged version of the Goomba. It jumps every few seconds, and follows the player if he goes past him.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- Being a winged enemy, the only place it fits in is the sky.<br />
- Paragoombas are only used in World 9 in the original game for a reason : they are very hard to kill without losing your power-up.<br />
- Since it's a difficult enemy to beat, place one of them alone, not two, not three, not more. Otherwise, the player will probably die trying to avoid them, and will get frustrated.<br />
- If you are using a size hack, be aware that the sprite won't resize if it's in the same screen as an entrance to a zone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Place Behind Other Sprites : This allows other sprites to appear in front of the Paragoomba. It can be useful to hide them behind other things and surprise the player. Since it's already hard to avoid hitting them, this shouldn't really be used.<br />
- *Scale/Size (Nyb5/7) : Allows setting a custom size for this sprite. It requires Sprite 246 (Special Event) and that sprite's function set to "Selective Sprite Hack" and to "Nybble 5/7".<br />
- *Colour : Allows using a custom retexture. Most of the options have straightforward names, but some don't. Gloomba is dark grey, Hyper is dark blue and Bella is light pink. Santa Goombas have a santa hat on their heads.</div></div><br />
*<strong>Pumpkin Goomba</strong> (Sprite 22)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Probably Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
A Goomba (or Paragoomba) with a pumpkin on their head. Takes two hits to kill.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- Being a pumpkin implies that this fits only in haunted places (Ghost House, Haunted Land...)<br />
- The Paragoomba is a bit buggy, and hard to kill for the average player, so don't use it too often.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Paragoomba : Replaces the Goomba with a Paragoomba.</div></div><br />
<strong>Horizontally/Vertically-Moving Platform</strong> (Sprite 23 and 31)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes<br />
Notes : These platforms are NOT controlled by lines.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
Platforms that move horizontally/vertically back and forth. They can be jumped on from below, and their movement speed isn't changeable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage : </strong><br />
- These sprites should be used in places with pits (such as sky or lava) or in vertical levels that require the player to reach a certain height (platforms help him progress). If you have a very large pit, it's recommended to use other types of platforms (such as Sprite...)<br />
- There are two colors available for the platforms : Yellow and Grey. While the former can be used everywhere, the latter is recommended in dark enviroments only (such as lava).<br />
 <br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Unknown ID : This probably does nothing. Just ignore it.<br />
- Event Activated : This can be useful to create puzzle gimmicks, such as a switch that activates the platform and after the timer ends it disappears. It requires the next setting to be set correctly.<br />
- Triggering Event ID : This is used to link the event activator to the platform, so that when the activator is triggered, the platform appears/disappears. It requires activating the previous setting to work.<br />
- Slow Down : This option makes the platforms' deceleration before switching direction longer, but it normally isn't needed.<br />
- Bowser Boss Battle Platform : Instead of the normal model, a texture from Bowser's boss bridge will be used. It's never been used, so i don't know how it looks.<br />
- Color : Explained above. There's one duplicate for each color, but there's no difference between it and the original.<br />
- Start Direction : Where the platforms should move first. It should be taken in mind because, when the player approaches it in-game, the platform either goes near the player and allows him to land on it, or it goes away and the player needs to wait for it to come back.<br />
- Movement Distance : The total running distance of the platforms, a sum of left/down and right/up.<br />
- Width : It's measured in tiles (you can activate the Grid to make accurate measurements before placement). Do not set it to 0 or 1, or it will look horrible. Even then, it's recommended to not set it lower than 4, or the player will have a hard time trying to make a perfect jump.<br />
</div></div><br />
<strong>Buzzy Beetle</strong> (Sprite 24)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
An enemy similar to Koopas, but with a blue shell and immunity to fireballs. Yoshi can eat them and spit them out as shells, just as Koopas.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage : </strong><br />
- This sprite should only be used in dark themes (such as lava and underground stages). In enviroments such as Grassland, they'd stand out too much, and wouldn't fit.<br />
- Though if you're using Newer, you can use the custom colors to make them fit in your level more.<br />
- If you want to use the upside-down version (which falls of ceilings when the player approaches), consider making them visible and avoidable (so don't place them over the screen or in levels with low lighting, or the player won't be able to react in time.)<br />
- If you are using a size hack, be aware that the sprite won't resize if it's in the same screen as an entrance to a zone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Type : Buzzy Beetles can walk both on ground and ceiling. They can also be inserted as simple blue shells by using settings 2 and 3. Please note that "Upside-Down Shell" only works on the ground, it does not stand on ceilings.<br />
- *Scale/Size (Nyb5/7) : Allows setting a custom size for this sprite. It requires Sprite 246 (Special Event) and that sprite's function set to "Selective Sprite Hack" and to "Nybble 5/7".<br />
- *Colour : Allows using a custom retexture. The options are straightforward.<br />
</div></div><br />
<strong>Spiny</strong> (Sprite 25)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
These quadrupedes are similar to Buzzy Beetles but, opposed to them, can only be killed with a Fire Flower. Yoshi can eat them and spit them out as shells, and can jump on them without taking damage.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- This enemy can be used only in Desert themed levels, as their color and shape would stand out too much in other themes.<br />
- Theoretically they could be used wherever Lakitu is present, but there are Spinies falling from the sky already, it would be too much.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Starts as : You can make Spinies appear as normal enemies or simple shells (the latter is never used so it's not recommended), or even look like spawned from non-existant Lakitus. <br />
- Unknown Value 11 : Does nothing. Just ignore it.</div></div><br />
<strong>Upside-Down Spiny</strong> (Sprite 26)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
The ceiling-walking version. Like the other ones, Yoshi can eat them and spit them out.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- This enemy can be used only in Desert themed levels, as their color and shape would stand out too much in other themes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Unknown Flag 8 : This option does nothing, it only creates a bug : misplaced enemies will walk in mid-air. It's recommended to keep it disabled.</div></div><br />
<strong>Vertically/Horizontally-Moving DS Stone Block</strong> (Sprite 27 and 28)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Reggie Next only (?)<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
The grey moving blocks from the DS game (hence the name). They are unused, and have a terrible bug. When both width and height have a value higher than 1, the inner part of the block isn't filled, and it looks horrible. Using a width or height of 1 allows to hide such behaviour.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- They should be used in indoor environments (such as Tower, Castle and Ghost House). In most cases you will find a prettier alternative.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
- Event Activated : This can be useful to create puzzle gimmicks, such as a switch that activates the block and after the timer ends it disappears (it requires a Switch). It requires the next setting to be set correctly.<br />
- Triggering Event ID : This is used to link the event activator to the block, so that when the activator is triggered, the block appears/disappears. It requires activating the previous setting to work.<br />
- Slow Down : This option makes the block deceleration before switching direction longer, but it normally isn't needed.<br />
- Height/Width : Measured in blocks<br />
- Movement Distance : The total running distance of the platform, both left/up and right/down.</div></div><br />
<strong>Ac_Lift_ObjBg_HMove_Big</strong> (Sprite 29) :<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">Doesn't load anything. It's useless.<br />
</div></div><br />
<strong>Unused Stone Tower Block</strong> (Sprite 30)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description :</strong><br />
Light grey blocks that move back and forth.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- Due to existing alternatives, this sprite is almost never used, so there's no real theme in which it fits.<br />
- Using speed and delays, you can make them move exactly when you want them to, and create neat alternations or synchronizations.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
<br />
- Event Activated : This can be useful to create puzzle gimmicks, such as a switch that activates the block and after the timer ends it disappears (it requires a Switch). It requires the next setting to be set correctly. Please note that deactivating the block requires it to be offscreen.<br />
- Triggering Event ID : This is used to link the event activator to the block, so that when the activator is triggered, the block appears/disappears. It requires activating the previous setting to work.<br />
- Movement Direction : No need to explain<br />
- Start Delay : If activated, the block will wait 2 ticks of the level's clock before moving. After the initial movement has occurred, the next two settings are the ones managing delays.<br />
- Delay Before Going Right/Up : Sets how long it will stop after moving right/up. Each value is 2 ticks of the level's clock.<br />
- Delay Before Going Left/Down : Sets how long it will stop after moving left/down. Each value is 2 ticks of the level's clock.<br />
- Distance : How many tiles the block will move before returning to its starting point.<br />
- Speed : If you set a high speed, make sure you set a delay, or the player will have a hard time passing through.<br />
- Height/Width : In blocks</div></div><br />
<strong>Star Coin</strong> (Sprite 32)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : Yes<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong><br />
Simple collectible items, which allow to buy Hint Movies and Unlock Levels in World 9 (or unlock the entire World 9 in NewerSMBW).<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage :</strong><br />
- 3 Star Coins should be in every level which doesn't fit in the following : Peach's Castle/Yoshi's House, Toad Houses/Shops, Cannons, Ambushes, Title Screen, Credits/Intro<br />
- Make sure the Star Coins are not too easy to catch. They should involve a challenge, but it shouldn't be too hard. As you progress in the game, it's perfectly fine to make harder challenges for Star Coins, just don't go crazy and make kaizo things.<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings :</strong><br />
<br />
- Target Event ID : When the Star Coin is collected, this Event ID will be activated. It can be useful to trigger wall destructions, rising lava/poison/water, enemy/platform spawning...<br />
- Non-Timed Event : This sets whether the triggered event is timed or permanent<br />
- Place Behind Fence : No need to explain. It can be used to make small fence puzzles and require extra effort from the player.<br />
- Coin Number : Make sure the three coins don't have the same number, or you won't be able to collect them all. You can put more than one with the same number, if the additional ones can't be collected (see original 1-2)<br />
- Falls when POW is Used : Other than the intended effect, it also makes the Star Coin susceptible to other objects (such as Sand Geysers, conveyor belts...)<br />
- Place Behind Other Sprites : Can be used to hide the Star Coin, such as behind Bushes or Spike Pillars.</div></div><br />
<strong>Event Controller - Zone Enter</strong> (Sprite 33)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><em>Sprite Image available : No<br />
Yoshi Compatibility : Yes</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong> :<br />
This can be used to trigger events as soon as the level starts/the zone's entered. The trigger remains in memory in the whole level, and it isn't reset by changing area or zone.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Usage</strong> :<br />
The sprite's placement in the zone doesn't matter, but it's common sense to put it near the zone entrance. It works well with sprites that require an event ID, but you want to keep active at all times (such as Actor Spawner or Special Event).<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings</strong> :<br />
<br />
- Event ID : This ID will be activated/deactivated when the player enters the zone<br />
- Time Activated : This only works if Switch Mode is set to Activate Event, and sets a duration that the Event ID will be activated for. Use 0 for unlimited time.<br />
- Switch Mode : You can choose to activate or deactivate the specified event.<br />
- Does Nothing/Self Destructs : Unless you are too lazy to delete the sprite yourself, you can turn this on and have the game do it for you (The sprite still remains, but it doesn't do anything.)</div></div><br />
