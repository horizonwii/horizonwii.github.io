<br />
- Tileset Zoom (maybe default to 125-150% would be an idea)<br />
- Copy tiles and their Hex data between instances, Ctrl-click to copy multiple tiles<br />
- Drag-and-drop tiles around. Or, possibility to copy or cut tiles and their hex data and paste into any other tile<br />
- The Core/Terrain/Parameters box and the Properties box moves around and resizes when hovering over tiles<br />
<br />
- The left-click and right-click handler functions always confuse me. It also depends, if "Default" is selected or not. When I start Puzzle, nothing is selected, not even "Default". <br />
My idea would be to change this behavior completely:<br />
-> Left-click selects the tile and shows the corresponding Core/Terrain/Parameters/Properties values. The tile can now also be used to create objects.<br />
-> If one tile or multiple tiles are selected (with Ctrl-left-click as is already possible), then the tile "Behaviors" can be set and I recommend having an "Apply" button to save the changes.<br />
The Behaviors box could also reflect the settings of the currently selected tile, which would make it easier to modify existing tiles.<br />
Example: we left-click on the "Invisible solid-on-top tile" from Pa0_jyotyu.arc. On the right side in the Behaviors box, "Pass-through" and "Partial Block - Top Half" is automatically selected. If we don't change anything and click on Apply, the tile is unaltered. Lets' say we want to create an "invisible solid-on-bottom tile" then we would leave the "Pass-through" unchanged and only change the "Partial Block" to "Bottom Half".<br />
-> Right-click opens the context menu and allows to copy/cut/paste, or drag.<br />
<br />
- Get rid of the tabs and move the Objects frame to the main page, place it at the bottom.<br />
-> Top left frame: Tile settings and Tileset Map<br />
-> Top right frame: Behaviors<br />
-> Bottom frame: Objects</div></div></div></div><br />
Finally, here's a little list of reported bugs of previous, or current versions!<br />

				<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="index960a.html?page=post&amp;id=3837">Posted by Zementblock</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>Ah, nice to see you're updating Puzzle!! Great work so far, it runs as stable as the old version.<br />
<br />
Well it was inevitable, so here are my ideas. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br />
<br />
- Tileset Zoom (maybe default to 125-150% would be an idea)<br />
- Copy tiles and their Hex data between instances, Ctrl-click to copy multiple tiles<br />
- Drag-and-drop tiles around. Or, possibility to copy or cut tiles and their hex data and paste into any other tile<br />
- The Core/Terrain/Parameters box and the Properties box moves around and resizes when hovering over tiles<br />
<br />
- The left-click and right-click handler functions always confuse me. It also depends, if "Default" is selected or not. When I start Puzzle, nothing is selected, not even "Default". <br />
My idea would be to change this behavior completely:<br />
-> Left-click selects the tile and shows the corresponding Core/Terrain/Parameters/Properties values. The tile can now also be used to create objects.<br />
-> If one tile or multiple tiles are selected (with Ctrl-left-click as is already possible), then the tile "Behaviors" can be set and I recommend having an "Apply" button to save the changes.<br />
The Behaviors box could also reflect the settings of the currently selected tile, which would make it easier to modify existing tiles.<br />
Example: we left-click on the "Invisible solid-on-top tile" from Pa0_jyotyu.arc. On the right side in the Behaviors box, "Pass-through" and "Partial Block - Top Half" is automatically selected. If we don't change anything and click on Apply, the tile is unaltered. Lets' say we want to create an "invisible solid-on-bottom tile" then we would leave the "Pass-through" unchanged and only change the "Partial Block" to "Bottom Half".<br />
-> Right-click opens the context menu and allows to copy/cut/paste, or drag.<br />
<br />
- Get rid of the tabs and move the Objects frame to the main page, place it at the bottom.<br />
-> Top left frame: Tile settings and Tileset Map<br />
-> Top right frame: Behaviors<br />
-> Bottom frame: Objects</div></div>Oh hey, I like these ideas! Added to the thread! <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/wink.png" /><br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

It would be useful in some cases (e.g. if you renamed the <code>Pa3_rail.arc</code> or <code>Pa3_rail_white.arc</code> tileset to a different name), to show the hidden images of the tileset (which, if you're using the <code>Pa3_rail.arc</code> or <code>Pa3_rail_white.arc</code> tileset; are overlays for correct usage).</div></div>Oh, yes!
