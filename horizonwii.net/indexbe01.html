				Okay, so, this is basically a thread for a single modified Message Box that applies to all Newer Messages in Depot courses. All used IDs with their messages will be documented here. This way, Depot levels with custom Messages can go well with one another.<br />

...will be made eventually.<br />

				Erm, it takes a while to make a full mod. And a good one, at that. Plus, I wasn't rushing to finish it. I was taking my time, as I have many other things in life<br />
to worry about. I did start in late 2016. However, I scrapped a lot of levels for various reasons.<br />
<br />
I haven't posted the page on it, because it's my goal to officially announce it once World 3 and or 5 is complete.<br />
There is proof of it's existence. I am, of course, referring to my Depot stages that say the levels will be featured in an upcoming hack of mine.<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

Hey! I decided to make a level, and upload it for fun!<br />
This only works on original NewSMBW, not Newer!<br />
This is, I believe to be, my best course yet. I worked very hard on it,<br />
as it took around 12 collective hours of making and editing.<br />
<br />
I also had to make sure it didn't crash!<br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />

				Attention!<br />
<br />
The source code of Reggie! Next M3 has been updated a lot! It doesn't have a build yet,<br />
but there may be one in the near future. Regarding running the build from source, you will<br />
have to use Python v3.6 instead of v3.4 for it to work properly. The bat file in the download<br />
will most likely be updated at a later date.<br />
<br />
You're probably not going to see this message!<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />
