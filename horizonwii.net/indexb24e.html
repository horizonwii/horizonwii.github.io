				Oh. There's this old online meme from pannenkoek2012 about beating Super Mario 64 in 0.5 A presses. A youtube viewer (TJ Henry Yoshi) said that<br />
an A press is an A press.<br />

Then pannen made a video about it<br />

				I remembered I had this mod. It was lost when Rvlution was shut down.<br />
So I thought I'd post it here! This was created by John10v10!<br />
<br />
This mod lets you replace Mario, Luigi, Blue and Yellow Toad's model<br />
(Normal, Fire, Ice, Penguin, and Propeller Suit) with a box of whatever<br />
images you choose!  It will get replaced with any 512 by 512 image you want <br />
to replace it with. The download has 3 files, which are in the "Avatar" folder.<br />
Avatar1, Avatar2, and Avatar3n4.<br />
<br />
-Avatar1 is Mario<br />
-Avatar2 is Luigi<br />
-Avatar3n4 is Blue, and Yellow Toad (They share their model, and file)<br />
-The NPC Toad is also included in Avatar3n4. He only uses one texture.<br />
<br />
The download also includes an <del>useless Read Me</del> XML used for loading the<br />
3 Avatar files from the Avatar folder. Don't change the name of the 3 files, unless<br />
you don't want to use the Avatar XML. It's your choice!<br />
<br />
This can get pretty... "interesting" if you replace them with random images<br />
from the internet. I don't have any previews because all of the footage is<br />
gone.<br />
<br />
 I did make two mods from this. One of them is a pack. The characters inside<br />
are named as followed. Bootleg Mario, Bootleg Luigi, Bootleg Toad, and Bootleg<br />
Toadette! Together, they are... <strong>The Bootleg Squad!</strong><br />
<sub><sub>Oh, I also changed the other Toad... yeah.</sub></sub><br />

you could try downloading Newer at a friend's house.<br />

				Dang, you can type a lot! <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/jawdrop.png" /><br />
<br />
I've messed with that sprite before. Unfortunately, you can't control both players. When Sprite 9 and a normal entrance are in the same level, Mario's model usually loads from Sprite 9, but as you experienced, Mario is actually invisible from where you placed the normal entrance. If you were to make Sprite 9 a character that isn't being used (Luigi, Yellow or Blue Toad) then they will just stand there. You can interact with them as you usually would in multiplayer mode.<br />
<br />
I don't really think you can do that ghost idea, even though it's a nice one. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

				What CLF (Customlevelfan) is true.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any custom symbols after Z. I'd need to look into that.<br />
I just wanted to mention that the # symbol in Newer's Message blocks is a filled Blue Block <br />
(Like NSMBW's Red Blocks, but it's Blue).<br />
<del>I'll research more of these symbols later. I think I know all of them, actually.</del><br />
<br />
So I found something interesting. Newer's Messagefont file is like an amalgamation (combination)<br />
of NewSMBW's Message, and number font. Maybe a little bit of mariofont, I don't know. Anyways, the<br />
"Blue Block" image replaces the location where, in theory, the # symbol would be. Looking to the<br />
right of Blue Block image are some other images in place of some text symbols. Here's a little list<br />
of what image most likely replaces what symbol in Newer's Message Blocks.<br />
<br />
# = Blue Block<br />
$ = Yellow Block<br />
% = Green Block<br />
& = Question Block<br />
( = Toad House<br />
) = Another Toad House<br />
* = Another Toad House... (Literally all the same)<br />
+ = Purple Course Icon (Usually indicates if a course has 2 exits, and only one has been completed in Newer)<br />
- = Shop Course Icon (Represents Shops in Newer)<br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />
