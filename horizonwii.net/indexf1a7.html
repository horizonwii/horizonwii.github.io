<br />
The value 28, which is "Switch Palace" is definitely unused, as it's only text saying "Palace" in the code, and Newer uses images for the Switch Palaces. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

				I've found where and how you can modify the items that appear in the shops (in NewerSMBW).<br />
<br />
In the shop.cpp file, if you scroll a little down, you can see what files the game loads<br />
from the "lakitu.arc" file. It's as follows:<br />
<div class="codeblock">&quot;g3d/yoshi.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/desert.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/mountain.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/sakura.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/santa.brres&quot;, 
&quot;g3d/ghost.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/space.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/koopa.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/sewer.brres&quot;, &quot;g3d/goldwood.brres&quot;</div>Files "sewer.brres" and "koopa.brres" aren't actually in the lakitu.arc file. This means this is some unused<br />
code. Also, space.brres it the exact same as "yoshi.brres". But anyways, you could add more models in the world<br />
order you want them to be used.<br />
<br />
If you scroll past the halfway point, there will be a section showing the IDs of what show up in the shop.<br />
<br />
For example, in Yoshi's Island, it's shop has:<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">-A Mushroom for 1 Star Coin<br />
-A Fire Flower for 2 Star Coins<br />
-An Ice Flower for 2 Star Coins<br />
-A Propeller for 3 Star Coins<br />
-2 Fire Flowers & 1 Ice Flower for 5 Star Coins<br />
-2 Mushrooms, A 1-Up, & 2 Propellers for 8 Star Coins.<br />
</div></div>Those items like this in code:<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><div class="codeblock">MUSHROOM, FIRE_FLOWER, ICE_FLOWER, PROPELLER,
FIRE_FLOWER, ICE_FLOWER, FIRE_FLOWER,
MUSHROOM, MUSHROOM, ONE_UP, PROPELLER, PROPELLER</div></div></div>You can change what item is where by changing the name. This is what each item is in this code. I also put their IDs for... something I'm not sure of.<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton">Show spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><code>-MUSHROOM = Mushroom = 0<br />
-FIRE_FLOWER = Fire Flower = 1<br />
-ICE_FLOWER = Ice Flower = 2<br />
-PENGUIN = Penguin Suit = 3<br />
-PROPELLER = Propeller Mushroom = 4<br />
-MINI_SHROOM = Mini Mushroom = 5<br />
-STARMAN = Super Star = 6<br />
-HAMMER = Hammer Suit = 7<br />
-ONE_UP &#x3D; 1-Up Mushroom = 8</code></div></div><br />
This is how it functions. I'll start with the first line.<br />
<br />
The first item (commonly Mushrooms) is 1 Star Coin.<br />
The next 2 on the list (often Fire & Ice Flowers) are 2 Star Coins.<br />
The 4th item (Usually either Propeller, Penguin, or Hammer Suit) is 3 Star Coins.<br />
<br />
The 2nd line has the 3 items you can get for 5 Star Coins.<br />
<br />
The 3rd and final line has the 5 items you can get for 8 Star Coins.<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

				In Reggie, there's an option that lets you warp across the edges of the zones in each area.<br />
However, you would have to mimmick the its set up as shown in 01-20 in NSMBW. That course is<br />
the First Coin Battle Level, as pointed out by <a href="indexc5c8.html?page=profile&amp;id=34"><span style="color: #7C60B0;" class="userlink" title="9211tr (34) [Normal user]">9211tr</span></a>.<br />
<br />
It's... really hard and annoying to set up right. So I made an Area template that you can<br />
download and use for your levels! The level only has one area with one zone set up for your<br />
level. <br />
<br />
In the zone, there are blocks that show how to properly warp across the edges if you were to<br />
walk in a straight line.<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Show Spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><img class="imgtag" src="../i67.tinypic.com/2yjy9v8.png" alt=""/><br />
This shows how to set up the warping across the edges. You just need to extend the ground about<br />
4 tiles out of the zone like so.</div></div><br />
There are a few things you need to know before using this.<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Show Spoiler</button><div class="spoiled hidden">-The Zone is set to "Scroll Bottom to Top". You can change<br />
this to "Scroll Top to Bottom" if you want.<br />
<br />
-You can delete the blocks at the bottom. They are just an<br />
example.<br />
<br />
-This works for New and Newer SMBW<br />
<br />
-The Zone is set to "Y Tracking" only.<br />
...It's best to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
-The Zoom level is set to 1.<br />
...It's also best to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
-You can change the Y size of the zone. If you do, though,<br />
I suggest you do from changing the Y size # itself. <br />
<br />
-The Y Position needs to stay 481.<br />
The X Position needs to stay 256.<br />
Why? Because otherwise, the edge warping will be more like<br />
edge teleportation. Also, some sprites might Glitch out or<br />
act weird.<br />
<br />
-Keep in mind that pretty much all sprites warp across the<br />
stage edges as well.</div></div><br />
With all that said, here's the download link:<br />
<a href="https://mega.nz/#!uVJgwDgJ!9f7wPYcLIzdebDK2Dwvv1XJwcDlnr4rVAGsi1QDCJh4">https://mega.nz/#!uVJgwDgJ!9f7wPYcLIzdebDK2Dwvv1XJwcDlnr4rVAGsi1QDCJh4</a><br />
<br />
Oh! Also, here's the test level for this I made!<br />
<a href="https://mega.nz/#!6UZ01DBb!M7GYD-mYno1KRsswa5YvgmbgojadZR7bsp-v60Ue_24">https://mega.nz/#!6UZ01DBb!M7GYD-mYno1KRsswa5YvgmbgojadZR7bsp-v60Ue_24</a><br />
<br />
Don't play it! It's really really bad! I was honestly<br />
just testing the template, but then I got bored and <br />
decided to make a level out of it. Oops!<br />

				Well, I messed mine up trying to edit something, and I didn't make a back-up copy.<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />
