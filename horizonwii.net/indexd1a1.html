in Reggie! Next.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it lets you copy and paste an area from another level, if you don't have 4 Areas.<br />
When you select the option, and choose the course, It'll ask which area to choose to add<br />
from the level. Decide which one to take, and then select it. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br>_________________________<br><div class="signature">I need to make a signature...<br />

<strong>Ideas</strong><br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Ideas From Discord</button><div class="spoiled hidden">- Mention that Rolling Barrels and Loose Arrows crash in NewerSMBW<br />
- Make Sprites be rendered behind Layer 0 in Reggie! Next<br />
<strong>Snapping Zones</strong><br />
Dragging Zones behaves similar to Sprites and/or Tiles. <br />
Of course, there would also be an option to go back to how Zones are now.<br />
</div></div><br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Ideas From Danster</button><div class="spoiled hidden">(With a little bit of CLF's ideas)<br />
- Make the Comments on course <u>stay</u> after you close the level, unless you delete it<br />
<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'>Posted by Discord</div><div class='quotecontent'>You know how when NSMBW's original Pa0_jyotyu tilesets are being used, images from Reggie are loaded to show hidden blocks, and what items are in which box? Well, could you add an option to turn that on or off for any Pa0 tileset?<br />
<br />
This goes for line display for Pa3_rail tilesets as well.</div></div>- More sprite images and allow scaling for Newer Size Hack<br />
- Sprite Images for Newer retextures<br />
- Add a ReggieData Updater (SpriteData, SpriteCategories, Images, etc)<br />
- Somehow make it visually easier to set up Connected Pipes. Not sure how you'd go by doing this, but this could be used as reference. This is only for Newer, by the way. OG NSMBW's Connected Pipes are jank, so you don't need to deal with that. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/tongue.png" /> <a href="index1a79.html?page=thread&amp;id=49&amp;from=200#post3169">http://horizonwii.net/?page=thread&id=49&from=200#post3169</a><br />

<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="index70b2.html?page=post&amp;id=3219">Posted by customlevelfan78</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>Just an extra HTML page on the help tab. Could be done.</div></div>- When you change a tileset, some tiles that aren't present in the new tileset are represented with question marks. Add an option somewhere to remove those tiles<br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Ideas From Zementblock</button><div class="spoiled hidden"><div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="index71fb.html?page=post&amp;id=3046">Posted by Zementblock</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>Have one stable editor where all the basics work:<br />
- No sprite crashes the editor<br />
The other things are bonuses and not that important (Real View, Collision etc).<br />
<br />
Tile God ~<br />
It would be nice, if the tiles spawned via Tile God could show the "real" tile in gray.<br />
Example: In the Tile God settings we set 1 as the row and 14 as the column and this would spawn a coin from Pa0 if set to mode 8. Now if it could actually <em>show</em> that coin in gray instead of just the Tile God sprite would be fantastic.<br />
<br />
Actor Spawner ~<br />
Exactly the same thing: Show the sprite selected in the AS settings in gray instead of just the AS sprite. Now the origin of the sprite would not always match the in-game position, but it would be better than nothing and a huge improvement working with AS.<br />
<br />
Favorite sprites in the top navbar!<br />
<br />
The possibility to add an info picture to the "Modify selected sprite" window.<br />
It would also be nice to show a picture of the selected sprite, which could be pulled from the already available sprite images</div></div><br />
<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="index1cc2.html?page=post&amp;id=3420">Posted by Zementblock</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>Thanks Stella (and only Stella), that was quick! <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br />
<br />
This editor is so lightning fast I... I still can't believe my eyes when changing zones!<br />
And it feels really really stable.<br />
<br />
Some small recommendations if you allow:<br />
<br />
- Also, the first level is always loaded as "Unsaved"<br />
<br />
- For easier versioning, the menu item "Save a copy as..." would be useful, or the ability to auto-save the level every xy minutes (%LEVELNAME%_%LONGDATE%)<br />
- Some clever way to protect the original levels so that they can't be overwritten by the user (can be done with File/Folder permissions but too complicated for the average user). If you could force the user to "Save As" instead of "Save" a modified original level, would be perfect. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /></div></div><div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="indexfb6d.html?page=post&amp;id=3060">Posted by the same person</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>- If technically possible, add ability to copy/paste locations, entrances and paths instead of just tiles and sprites.<br />
- Most levels are horizontal, but Mouse scrolling only works vertical. Now for those who don't know, you can scroll horizontal by pressing the ALT key while scrolling, or while hovering over the bottom scroll bar and scrolling.<br />
Maybe someone has an idea to improve this situation.<br />
The only thing I could think of is to give the option to swap up/down and left/right scrolling behavior. I know this would be very counter-intuitive, but could prove useful.<br />
- An Events list (which events are used)</div></div><div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="indexfb6d.html?page=post&amp;id=3060">Posted by someone totally different</a></div><div class='quotecontent'><div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'><a href="indexfb6d.html?page=post&amp;id=3060">Posted by Trello</a></div><div class='quotecontent'>- Multivalue data type<br />

- Remove dragging zone borders with pointer : this doesn't actually move or resize a zone, so it's pointless to even keep it<br />
- Add tileset/BG to reggiedata : It would be cool to select a custom tileset and then being able to save it in the .xml file for future use<br />
- Listen to music : When selecting a track, there could be a button to redirect to an online resource and listen to the song. Low priority but very useful with Newer, as the song list is confusing<br />
- Delete Button : Instead of only keeping cut and paste i'd be glad to be able to delete things, especially entrances, paths and locations.

================<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">Impossible Right Now</button><div class="spoiled hidden">- Seeing the background in the canvas<br />
We'd need someone to take the pictures of the backgrounds seamlessly looping on the left and right side of the screen<br />
<br />
- Add translations for different languages<br />
We'd need someone who knows different languages and is willing to translate more than 1000 words.<br />
<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'>Posted by Customlevelfan78</div><div class='quotecontent'>I have a full Italian translation, if anyone wants to implement it (only strings.xml and a few more things)</div></div><br />

<br />
But now... it's being worked on! Wow!</div></div><br />

Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />

for Mario going down, but if Mario were to go back into the pipe, it wouldn't work. :/<br />

This editor is so lightning fast I... I still can't believe my eyes when changing zones!<br />
And it feels really really stable.<br />
<br />
Some small recommendations if you allow:<br />
<br />
- The editor always loads 01-01 instead of last-used<br />
- Last Used Levels History<br />
- Also, the first level is always loaded as "Unsaved"<br />
<br />
- For easier versioning, the menu item "Save a copy as..." would be useful, or the ability to auto-save the level every xy minutes (%LEVELNAME%_%LONGDATE%)<br />
- Some clever way to protect the original levels so that they can't be overwritten by the user (can be done with File/Folder permissions but too complicated for the average user). If you could force the user to "Save As" instead of "Save" a modified original level, would be perfect. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /></div></div><del>I don't managed this thread at all</del><br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />
