				You can't edit a platforming game without some kind of level editor. The official NSMBW level editor is called Reggie! and can be found below:<br />

<div class="spoiler"><button class="spoilerbutton named">The Story of Donkey Kong</button><div class="spoiled hidden">It all starts like this. Ganon captured Link. Then Zelda found out that the triforce had 4 pieces. not 3. She went to the triforce and threw the 3rd shard (that is black) at it. the shard went in the middle. Then she punched it for its power and then there was a gigantic explosion. Everyone died but zelda and ganon and link. Ganon and Link started fighting. Athend, Ganon hit link to the ground. Ganon was about to end it when captain falcon came out of somewhere i mean nowhere and used falcon punch. Then he exploded and died. Zelda said "wow Link sucks." Link heard, got pissed, Transformed into Dark Link and exploded. Ganon was so shocked he died out of laughter. zelda almost had the same fate but the triforce which is now black and Purple aura copied Zelda's apperance and then gained 4 heads and a dragon tail. Its name is dragon zelda. zelda acted like she was all and powerful. dragon zelda charged at zelda and she hit the floor. She started crying alot. then toon link and young link came out of nowhere i mean somewhere and went beside zelda. they screamed "AHHHHHH!!!" and exploded. then they reformed to a toon female link with pink hair. fink. fink acted like she was all and powerful. but then dragon zelda charged at fink and she hit the floor. this time she was actually dead. Now everyone was dead but dragon zelda. Now she turns into a shiek with a bigger dragon tail. she teleported to a dimension with everything normal. because she can. then she looked for zelda. she found her, killed her instanly and became the new zelda. <br />

				I was wondering if you're able to make Yoshi compatible with Koopaling battles. Currently, when Yoshi ground pounds on them, they despawn like the other enemies. It would be nice if it did normal damage instead.<br />
<br />
Also, for castle bosses with in Koopalings, they can't move after the short cutscene of Kamek using her magic. And in multiplayer mode, if one player heads to where the cutscene is triggered while the other player on Yoshi is on them, I believe they die. This is probably hardcoded, though. If anything, you could just spawn Yoshi in the boss fight, but I thought this was worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I remember someone that showed up on Rvlution with multiple NSMBW Code mods out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
For one, he made a Lagless multiplayer mod for PAL users on Dolphin.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nq9UVEwRW5U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
He also made this very intreging gravity mod, that I was wondering if you'd like to try out making. It's unreleased, though.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jVPvC0NBXvk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
He also made the Score counter useful, by using it as a timer for speedrunners.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DCylvSznlC4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
Probably the best thing he has done, though, was this Portal mod replacing the Ice Flower. I'll let the video<br />
speak for itself.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kR4PQFTYyy0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
He was a nice guy. Wish he was still here.<br />

				Credit to Vanilla Lumina for creating this thread. I simply copy and pasted it from <a href="http://www.mariomods.net/thread/8-how-to-make-a-post-layout" target="_blank">here.</a><br />
<br />
<div class='quote'><div class='quoteheader'>Posted by Vanilla Lumina</div><div class='quotecontent'>A guide on how to make a post layout!<br />
<br />
First off, you need some basic HTML and CSS knowledge, to make a decent enough layout so that it is readable. <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/smile.png" /><br />
<br />
You need to put in the post header:<br />
<div class="codeblock">&lt;style&gt;
~~layout code go here~~
&lt;/style&gt;
</div><br />
Next, we need to add the correct classes. The tilde will be used in place of your user , please make sure you get this correct for each class or it will screw up other people's layouts when they post in the same thread and page.<br />
<br />
<strong>.mainbar~</strong> - Controls the background and general elements of the post.<br />
<strong>.sidebar~</strong> - Controls the sidebar of your posts.<br />
<strong>.topbar~_1</strong> - Controls the left side where your username is displayed on the top bar.<br />
<strong>.topbar~_2</strong> - Controls the right side where the 'Link' 'Quote' and post date etc. are listed on the top bar.<br />
<br />
Additions to .mainbar~, these can be placed by writing '.mainbar~ .newclass' in your post layout.<br />
<br />
<strong>.quoteheader</strong> - Controls the 'Posted by' on the quote header.<br />
<strong>.quotecontent</strong> - Controls the actual quote's contents.<br />
<strong>div.codeblock</strong> - Controls code BBCode tag blocks.<br />
<strong>.spoilerbutton</strong> - Controls the spoiler tag button.<br />
<strong>.spoiled</strong> - Controls the content inside a spoiler.<br />
<br />
Another thing you can do is add a Post Box with a DIV, you can do this by making a class of whatever name you want, setting a custom margin and padding, and then setting up the rest of it yourself. Remember to add after the style tag your div class, and close it in the footer.<br />
<br />
Here's an example code to help you out, it is the same as the code on my layout.<br />
Header:<br />
<div class="codeblock">&lt;style&gt;
.mainbar1 {
background:url(http://i.pi.gy/WRmP.jpg) center top !important;
background-width:100% !important;
color:white;
font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif;
border: 3px solid #066;
text-shadow: -1px -1px black, 0px -1px black, 1px -1px black, 1px 0px black, 1px 1px black, 0px 1px black, -1px 1px black, -1px 0px black;
}

.sidebar1 {
background:url(/themes/bstruct/back.png) repeat !important;
color:white;
font-family:Tahoama,sans-serif;
border: 3px solid #066;
text-align:center;
}

.topbar1_1, .topbar1_2 {
background: #066 url(/themes/glossy/generic_gloss.svg) repeat !important;
background-size:100% 100%;
color:white;
font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif;
}

.topbar1_1 {
text-align:center;
}

.mainbar1 div.codeblock {
background:rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
color:white;
}

.postbox1 {
margin:20px;
border:3px solid #066;
background:rgba(0,102,102,0.65);
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;postbox1&quot;&gt;
</div>Footer:<br />
<div class="codeblock">&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;postbox1&quot;&gt;[user 1]&lt;/div&gt;</div><br />
Make sure to disable signature separator and then set 'Apply layout to entire post box'.<br />
<br />
Tips:<br />
* Make sure your layout is readable on all themes. This is usually done by manually forcing a colour.<br />
* Don't use GIFs in your background.<br />
<br />
* Feel free to customise it to the max!<br />
* Check your layout is fully compatible with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, since these are the most-conforming to web standards.<br />
* Don't use fixed backgrounds as they lag the page on some browsers such as Safari and look odd on mobile devices.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <img class="smiley" alt="" src="img/smilies/biggrin.png" /><br />
(Note that the reason I didn't use my ID here on the example is because I copied it from my own board.)</div></div><br />
