			<description><![CDATA[We now have a new level depo!<br />
<br />
I re-wrote the entire level depo to introduce new features and a more user friendly experience. <br />
<br />
Let me go through everything:<br />
-The home page of the depo shows one of the following: Featured levels, trending levels, or older levels that are brought up in case you missed them. These categories come and go whenever you refresh the page.<br />
<br />
-Each theme has their own sub page. This way you can see each theme individually! There is also an "all" tab for all recent submissions/themes<br />
<br />
-New autumn theme added<br />
<br />
-All depo submissions starting now will be relayed to the Level Showcase forum for discussion on said level<br />
<br />
Coming soon<br />
Special backgrounds for each theme subpage<br />
Following tab to follow creators<br />
<br />
That's about it, have fun depositing!]]></description>
